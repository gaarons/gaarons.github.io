The federal reserve is responsible for constraining an out of control economic expansion.  The job of the federal reserve is to 'pull away the punch bowl, just when the party is getting good!'  The response of the federal reserve to the economic build up in years preceding the financial crisis of 2008, can be seen in the figures below.

There is major disagreement about criteria of policy, varying from emphasis on money market conditions, interest rates, and the quantity of money to the belief that the state of employment itself should be the proximate criterion of policy.\cite{Friedman} Following this line of thought, the execution of discount window primary credit rate hikes by the federal reserve were ill timed.  Actions by the federal reserve need to be more targeted in the highly leveraged and unstable economy that had been building prior to the financial crisis of 2008.
