% Data Compiler
The data sets for this type of problem can grow to be quite large.  In good spirits about potentially using our algorithm at the end of this project, to trade in the market, we made the decision to create a data compiler.  In retrospect this aspect of the project was quite difficult, but we are happy to have executed a successful sorting routine for our raw daily prices.  

Before testing our algorithm in the present market, we will be running it historically over the 5 years of data we have organized.  In this vetting stage for our algorithm, we will be able to detect any flaws and pitfalls possibly hidden in the objective function, the parameters, or in the type of filter we apply.
